# stor

Stor is a simple application for creating and managing lists of arbitrary information. Lists can be related to each other and can have application-like actions composed upon them.

Stor is a rails 3.x / ruby 1.9.x app. Data is currently stored in mongo. It expected to always be most suitable to use an Object DB due to the dynamic nature of the data.
